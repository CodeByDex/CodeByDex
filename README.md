- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeByDex
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, always seem to be picking up some new hobby.  Currently in rotation knitting and sewing; previously, baking and fermitting though they will probably come back into rotation this winter. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning newer technologies, decided to re-invest in myself.  I graduated with a degree in computer science and mathematics in 2012 and have spent the time since working in corporate america wearing a few different hats always in the .NET space. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not sure yet, probably study partners for the boot camp program I've enrolled in.
